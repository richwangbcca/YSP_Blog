                UPLC-MS/MS stands for Ultra Performace Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry. The UPLC-MS/MS
                    combines the two techniques to reveal more information about a sample.

                Liquid chromatography separates samples into its individual components. The mixture passes
                through a solid adsorbant material, and different components have different flow rates,
                allowing the mixture to separate.

                Mass spectrometry measures the mass-to-charge ratio of ions, reavealing the chemical identity
                of a compound. The sample is ionized and accelerated, then passed through an electric/magnetic
                field. Ions with different mass-charge ratios will undergo different amounts of deflection,
                allowing the spectrometer to identify the ion. The UPLC-MS/MS does this twice, using the daughter
                ions formed from the first mass spectrometry as the parent chemical in the next, to identify more
                components.

                The machine returns a chromatogram of the components in a sample. By taking the integral of the
                chromatogram, you can see the amount of the component that was in the sample. By using multiple
                samples over a period of time, you can see how the amount of the component changes over time.
