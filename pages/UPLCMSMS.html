                    UPLC-MS/MS stands for Ultra Performace Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry. The UPLC-MS/MS combines the two techniques to reveal more information about a sample.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Liquid chromatography separates samples into its individual components. The mixture passes through a solid adsorbant material, and different components have different flow rates, allowing the mixture to separate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mass spectrometry measures the mass-to-charge ratio of ions, reavealing the chemical identity of a compound. The sample is ionized and accelerated, then passed through an electric/magnetic field. Ions with different mass-charge ratios will undergo different amounts of deflection, allowing the spectrometer to identify the ion. The UPLC-MS/MS does this twice, using the daughter ions formed from the first mass spectrometry as the parent chemical in the next, to identify more
                    components.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The machine returns a chromatogram of the components in a sample. By taking the integral of the chromatogram, you can see the amount of the component that was in the sample. By using multiple samples over a period of time, you can see how the amount of the component changes over time.
