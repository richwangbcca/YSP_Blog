                        I worked under <a href=https://site.caes.uga.edu/huanglab>Dr. Jack Huang at UGA Griffin</a> to evaluate various methods of degrading PFAs, or perfluoroalkyl substances. PFAs are synthetic compounds containing fluorine atoms bonded to a chain of carbon atoms. They are described as persistant organic pollutants, which do not degrade naturally. PFAs are commonly found in fire extinguishing foams, water repellants, shampoos, and cosmetics. It is also found in Teflon, a common material developed by DuPont, and the subject of the 2019 movie <em>Dark Waters</em>. Over time, PFAs can build up in people's  bodies, especially in firefighters, chemical manufacturers, and processing workers. The chemical can also build up in people  who drink PFA-contaminated water, eat contaminated fish, inhale contaminated soil or air, and use products packaged in PFAs. PFA exposure leads to a wide variety of health problems, such as decreased fertility, developmental delays in children, increased risk of cancer, compromised immune system and vaccine response, hormone interference, increased cholesterol levels, and birth defects. Because of its persistancy and health effects, much research has been done to find ways to degrade PFAs.

                            The method of PFA degradation I will try is called <strong>electrochemical oxidation</strong> with an SiC anode. When the PFAs are in the electrolyte solution in an electrolytic cell, the fluorine atoms are ripped off of the carbon chain, degrading the PFAs. I started with stoichiometry to determine how many mL of certain PFAs I need for 50 mL of a 2uM solution. I then determined the mass of the Na2SO4 needed to put in the solution. The Na2SO4 dissolves in the solution, forming ions that allow electrons to pass through the solution. Then, using the area of an SiC anode, I determined many mA of electricity I needed to run through the solution if I used 5mA per square centimeter.

                            Using a stainless steel cathode and an SiC anode, I created an electrolytic cell that would oxidize and degrade the PFAs. I collected samples from the solution every 30 minutes. Tomorrow, I will run them in the UPLC-MS/MS. The UPLC-MS/MS uses liquid chromatography to separate the solution and mass spectrometry to analyze the mass. By determining the amount of remaining PFA, I can see the effectiveness of the new SiC anode. Depending on how effective the initial experiments are, we will try different amperages.

                            First, I used the UPLC-MS/MS to create chromatograms of the PFOs and M8PFOs concentrations to determine how much was degraded. Dividing the PFOs concentration by the M8PFOs concentration shows how much the PFOs degraded over time. The results were not promising, and I realized later that the vortex mixer did not completely mix the contents inside the vial insert. I redid the experiment, but this time I did not use the inserts, took samples every hour, and doubled the amperage from 5mA per square centimeter to 10mA per square centimeter. In total, it was 16mA of electricity. Around hour 4, foam started forming in the solution. This foam was from the electrolysis of water in the solution, forming hydrogen and oxygen bubbles. The foam needed to disappear before the samples were taken, either by just waiting for them to disappear or taking out the cathode and the anode to prevent the bubbles from clinging on.

                            I continued to run the electrochemical oxidation of yesterday's PFOs sample using the SiC anode, taking samples every hour. I ran the samples through the UPLC-MS/MS, and around 80% of the PFOs remained at hour 7. According to my supervisor, this anode was not as effective as some of the ones his lab has tested in the past.

                            I will start a new experiment today. I will run a TiO2 anode and an SiC anoode under a powerful mercury vapor lamp. The mercury vapor lamp emits light in all three of the visible, ultraviolet, and infrared spectral regions. I will see if the light has any effect on PFA degradation. It is possible since the light can give the molecules more energy to break the C-F bonds. It will also increase the temperature of the solutions, also giving the molecules more energy. I will take samples from both solutions and measure the potential difference every hour.

                            After running the samples from June 9 in the UPLCS-MS/MS, I found that the lamp had no effect on PFOs degradation. I will test absorption of the SiC anode again. We used a brand new SiC anode and took samples every hour, and I will use the results as the control group for the SiC experiments. On another SiC anode, I will use 10mA per square centimeter again, or 16mA total.

                            After analyzing yesterday's results, I saw a considerable drop in PFA conentration! Both the 50mA and 30mA per square centimeter experiments dropped below 60% by the first hour. Today, I tested 40mA and 20mA per square centimeter, totaling to 64mA and 32mA respectively. The first time I tried it, the detergent was not completely rinsed out of the reaction chambers, causing lots of soap bubbles. I cleaned them out again, and had a successful experiment the second time.

                            I analyzed yesterday's results first thing in the morning and found that the 20mA per square centimeter experiment had lower concentrations of PFOs than the 30mA per square centimeter experiment, which does not make sense. Therefore, today, I will try the 20mA experiment again, along with a 15mA per square centimeter experiment, totaling to 24mA of electricity. After the first hour, the apparatus that held the electrodes broke for the 20mA experimen. I restarted the 20mA experiment at hour 1 of the 15mA experiment but started it at hour 0. The 15mA experiment will conclude one hour before the 20mA experiment does.
